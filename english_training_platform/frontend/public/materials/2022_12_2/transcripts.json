And research shows that in recent years its ice has melted faster than ever before. This month, as temperatures in northwestern Greenland approach all-time highs, researchers are encountering unusual, surprising levels of melting ice in the region.\nThe most significant concern here is how early this is all happening. Greenland experiences annual ice melt and growth cycles. But this year, the melting season began in early May. That's a month earlier than normal and something that's happened only once before in the historical record in 2016.\nThat means that not only is the ice melting very fast, it has more time to melt this summer than it would in a normal climate system. Longer melt seasons like this one seem to lead to much greater contributions to sea level rise than in previous decades.",

Birthdays can tap into a lot of things people worry about, including their achievements in life in the past decade, or their accomplishments of the past year. Many begin to search for the meaning of their existence, leading to behaviors such as ending or starting a relationship,or plans, like starting a vigorous diet or fitness program.\nM:I have wonderful friends and I love celebrating their birthdays. But I don't like being the center of attention, receiving gifts and having a fuss made. It seems to trigger a type of social anxiety. I think social media too can intensify things as birthdays now play out more publicly. Birthday reminders can be helpful, but I kind of worry I won't be able to drum up my own day and show it to look as exciting as it is supposed to be.\nW: Well, to deal with the birthday blues, you should not isolate yourself. It's best to gradually face your birthday with people you trust. That would help you learn self-acceptance, or that it's okay to be the focus.\nM: Perhaps.

Being a deaf person in tech required a huge amount of effort in organization. Because there was no email or text message service, everything had to be done face to face, or by telephone. Communicating in meetings was very difficult. He needed a sign language interpreter for every meeting, but it was a huge effort to coordinate.\nThese days, although challenges still remain, it's a good time to be a deaf person in tech,says Miller. Big advances in speech recognition technology have enabled communication tools to turn live speech into text in real time on your smartphone or laptop, and sign language into text as well.\nNew Tech coupled with improvements in hearing aid technology and medical advances means that Miller is able to focus far more on his work. He has benefited to a great extent from a tiny hearing device in his ear. It gives him a degree of hearing, and he can use a variety of communication methods depending on the situation. He can employ lip-reading and have meetings via video instead of on the phone. These things have made a huge difference. He no longer has to worry about whether or not he can understand. He can just concentrate on how interesting the meeting might be and what he needs to get out of it in order to progress.",

Pure white walls simply don't do that.\nThey don't look after you.\nAnother interior designer commented that certain combinations can key into something on a deeper level, transporting you to a different moment in time. That's the power of colour.\nIf you are thinking to try colour on some of your neutral walls, the advice is refreshingly simple: Choose a colour you actually like.\nDon't go for a colour because it's in fashion, or you' ve seen it in a magazine.\nIf you' re weary of full colour, test your tolerance with smaller spaces, such as the inside of a cupboard or a bright window frame. If it gives you joy every time you open the cupboard, you can start to take it further.\nOne can also paint the wooden frameworks the same colour as the walls, helping the rooms look bigger. In the kitchen, painting the overhead cupboards and the walls in the same colour can make it feel more spacious.\nWhile painting the kitchen counters, a bold colour can make everything feel more open and lighter. Additionally, a painted ceiling is a magical thing without being too obvious and can affect how the space feels as well.",

In fact, in the United States, a little over half of children between the ages of three and five were read to every day in 2007, and 83% of children in that age group in the same country were read to three or more times per week in 2012.\nThis is good news, because reading to young children helps their language and brain development. In fact, recent research has found that both the quality and quantity of shared book reading in infancy predicted later childhood vocabulary and reading skills. In other words, the more time parents spend reading, the greater the developmental benefits in their four-year-old children.\nThis is an important finding. But does it matter what books parents read? A new study has investigated this question. It followed infants across the second six months of life and found that when parents showed babies books that had faces or objects with specific labels,they learned more. This is in contrast to books that did not name images, or books that had the same label under each image. Books that named different characters also promoted greater learning, So what does this mean for parents? Not all books are created equal, so parents need to choose the books they share with their children with great care.",
