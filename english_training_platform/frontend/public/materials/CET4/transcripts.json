Kitajima added that the cardboard beds were made to be even stronger than wooden beds.\n\nHowever, he did say there could be a problem if some athletes get too excited celebrating their gold-medal success. \"Of course, wood and cardboard would each break if you jumped on them,\" Kitajima said.\n\nThe Athletes Village Housing Center is expected to be completed in June. The Olympics are set to open in Tokyo on July 24.\n\nJapanese officials say the cardboard bed parts will be recycled into paper products after the games.",

To celebrate this year's anniversary, the British music company HMV and the music company Sony Classical recreated 500 copies of the first performance recorded to an LP.\n\nThe recording was of a piece of classical music: Mendelssohn's Concerto in E minor. All the copies of the LP are to be given away to fans, except for one, which will be donated to the British Library.\n\nThe record adds to the library's collection of 250,000 LPs, most of which were released in Britain. The museum has other musical artifacts going back to the beginning of sound recording. These include wax cylinders, created by Thomas Edison in 1877. They were the first way fans could buy music to listen to at home.",

And scientists say NASA's Juno spacecraft has led to new findings about Jupiter. They don't know how deeply these bands extend, though, but information from Juno has led them to conclude that Jupiter's outer layer extends 1,900 miles beneath the surface of the planet.\n\nSo, how did they come up with this? Juno took measurements of Jupiter's gravitational field, which scientists use to more deeply analyze the planet. They also concluded that though Jupiter's interior is thought to be fluid, it rotates like a solid body. The Juno mission cost the U.S. a little over $1.1 billion. It's hoped to help scientist better understand the solar system's largest planet. Jupiter is located fifth in line from the sun. Both Jupiter and the Juno's spacecraft were named after characters in Roman mythology.",

Since the founding of the country people have come from different countries in search of a better life and opportunities. Immigration laws, however, are always changing and are complicated. This leads to many people coming into the US without proper legal status. It is estimated that there are more than 11 million undocumented people in the Unites States. While some people will say there is no reason for immigrants to be undocumented in the US, there are limits on the amount of Green Cards, or legal permanent resident cards that people from certain countries can get. There are also long waiting lists, up to 14 years in some cases, for people coming from certain countries, to apply for legal status in the US. Additionally there are a limited amount of visas, or permits, for people coming into the US with manual labor skills. Millions of undocumented people have been deported, or sent back to their country of origin under President Obama.\n\nIn 2013, the US Senate passed an immigration reform bill. The law adds extra border security along the US-Mexico border, and also makes it easier for immigrants to become citizens. The bill, which also has to be approved by the House of Representatives, has not yet been presented or voted on in Congress. Because of this, many are asking President Obama to take action to protect some of the undocumented, many of whom have been in the US for many years and have children that are US citizens.",

Some people think ants follow each other by their sense of smell.\n\nAnts often live to be a year old, and some have been known to live six or seven years. One way they get their food is from plant insects which we might call their cows. The ants milk these \"cows\" by tapping the insects gently until a drop of honey comes out. Then they eat the honey. Ants take very good care of these plant insects and often build a covering over them so that they will be protected from the rain.",

The first of these was the rapid growth of technological and professional education to lead the urgent demands of a complex industrial and urban society. New schools of technology, engineering, architecture, law and medicine. Second was the provision for graduate study, such as what had long existed in France, and Germany. Harvard and John Hopkins Universities quickly took the lead in this field, but the state universities didn't lag far behind. Third was the increased provision for the education for women. This included the establishment of new women's colleges, such as Vassar, Wellesley and Smith, and the adoption of co-education in all the new state universities outside the south as well as in many private institutions. These developments, the growth of technological and professional education, the provision for graduate study and the increased educational opportunities for women began over a century ago, continue to this day, over ten decades since the end of the civil war.",
