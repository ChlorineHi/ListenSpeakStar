The 55-year-old woman's neighbors blame her for exacerbating a rat infestation, and they have spoken out at a council meeting last week. The woman's lawyer says she only feeds birds. But some of her neighbors say that she is also feeding rats, which have been spotted jumping from trees into a bird feeder. Anthony Moretti, the city's director of public works, said it will take months to get the problem under control.",

They strip out costs and preserve battery life for people who likely have inadequate access to electricity. Instead of a touchscreen, they're controlled with an old school keypad. But unlike the old feature phones, they can access the internet, use apps like WhatsApp, Facebook, Google Maps, and YouTube. And they can take pictures, although the quality isn't great. The phones cost around $20. The idea is to make phones that are affordable for people in developing countries. The goal is to give people access to the internet and digital services, even if they can't afford a smartphone.",

But now it's the other way around. New plastic is cheaper than recycled plastic. Why? Because of a boom in petroleum chemical production from the US. This has pushed down the price of new plastic. So the economics of recycling have been turned on their head. It's now cheaper for companies to use new plastic than recycled plastic. This is a problem for the recycling industry. It's also a problem for the environment. The UK government plans to tax companies which don't use at least 30% recycled plastic in their products. They're also planning to increase the quantity of recycled plastic in the market. The hope is that this will make recycled plastic more competitive with new plastic.

The Dreamery provides pajamas, essential oils, and a wake-up light. There are dozens of studies showing how napping improves memory, creativity, and productivity. But do you really need experts to tell you that? I mean, isn't it obvious that you're better at your job when you're not exhausted? I have a creative career, and the quality and quantity of work I can do emerges directly from my ability to concentrate. When I'm tired, my concentration is shot. I can either take a 20-minute nap and then do good work for the rest of the day, or I can struggle through in a state of exhaustion. What I find odd is that bosses insist that they take the second option and that napping is associated with laziness. It's as if they're saying, 'I don't care about the quality of your work. I just want to see you sitting at your desk, looking busy.' This attitude is counterproductive and outdated.",
