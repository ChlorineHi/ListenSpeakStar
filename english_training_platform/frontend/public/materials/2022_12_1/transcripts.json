The island is often described as heaven on earth by holidaymakers.\nFor decades tourists have been flocking to Palmador, which is located off the southeast coast of Spain. They come to enjoy its unspoiled beaches and crystal clear waters. Its natural beauty is protected as it lies inside a natural park.\nAlthough Palmador is one of the most famous private islands in the world, its seafront is public land and is a favorite destination for famous people. When the island was put up for sale, it was offered to the local government but proved too expensive for the local authorities. It is unclear whether the new owners have the power to ban tourists from the island. But with their newfound luxury comes the responsibility for its protection and maintenance. The island is less than two miles long and half a mile wide. It is said to have a remarkable location that few other private islands of this size can match, according to estate agents. Palmador is the perfect place to retreat to, somewhere to get away from the city noise and relax in beautiful surroundings with zero stress.",

My name is Carol Friedman.\nM. Carol Friedman. That's right. And you signed up two months ago. Currently we are offering existing members discounts off two of our brand new classes, hot yoga, and advanced spinning, but the discount doesn't apply to any of our regular classes I'm afraid.\nW: I'm only interested in the new classes. So how much of a discount is there on these two new classes?\nM: The same discount of 20% is being offered to everyone at the door on a\"first come, first served\" basis for the first month. It's a shame you missed out on the general discount.\nW:I see.\nM: But you can get 25% off if you sign up in advance. Which of the two classes are you thinking about?\nW: Well, I guess I am only really interested in hot yoga. Can you sign me up for the 10-week course on Thursday evenings?\nM: Sure. Would you prefer to pay in advance?\nW: No,I don't like giving my card details over the phone anyway.\nM: Okay, then. As you are already a member, the fee of the class will just be added to your monthly bill.\nW: That's perfect. Thanks for your help.\nM: See you Thursday.",

Can you find a map that shows where the hotel is and send it to me online? I' ve never been to the head office, you know.

The researchers behind the study state that many parts of the world have made good economic progress, but women's rights are often overlooked. Thus, they wanted to determine if there was a link between protection of women's rights and public health.\nThe researchers analyzed databases which held information from 162 countries for the period 2004 to 2010.\nCountries were classified according to the respect they gave to women's economic and social rights. There were three categories. They were high, moderate, and poor.\nAnalysis of the data showed that countries with strong women's rights had better health than those where women's rights were not as respected.\nThe health indicators studied included disease prevention, reproductive health, death rates, and life expectancy.\nFurthermore, in countries where women's rights were most respected, but where access to hospitals and doctors was below average, health outcomes were still better than in countries rated as moderate or poor. This confirms that even with a lack of resources, if a country has strong women's rights, the health outcomes are better.\nThus, the researchers argued that gender equality is not just a women's rights issue. It is also a development issue. This is because better health aids economic development. They note that the value of women's rights has often been questioned from an economic standpoint. Some have argued that ensuring those rights would limit progress, but this study indicates the opposite.",

You may think that summer is the perfect time to go on a date or chat with an attractive boy or girl. But excessive heat can cause you to lose water, which has been proven to have a pretty unattractive side effect—— bad breath.\nWhen you are lacking water, your mouth becomes dry. Bacteria accumulate because there isn't enough water in your mouth to wash it away. Sunshine can stop you from sweating, too. The body's normal temperature is 36 to 37 degrees centigrade. But if it heats up to 40 to 41 degrees, you may find yourself getting heatstroke. At that point, your heat regulatory system can essentially quit, which stops you from sweating as your body tries to keep water around your vital organs.\nHowever, the sun can have a positive influence on your body by raising your energy levels. You might feel like the sun is giving you extra energy for your day, which is actually happening.\nAnd vitamin D from sunshine can help your body to absorb certain minerals, which are linked to building stronger bones. Therefore, I suggest you spend more time in the park with your friends, but make sure you apply lots of skin protection and fill up those water bottles,too.",

Research found that they were overrepresented among fighters in combat sports. Left-handed fighters also had higher chances to win. This confirms the fighter theory.\nLeft-handers may also be better at remembering events. The explanation is that the two brain spheres of left-handers are more strongly connected.\nBeing left-handed might be a factor in mathematical ability. An Italian study found that for simple arithmetic there was little difference between right - and left-handed performance, but for more difficult problem-solving, left-handers won out. No one understands the reason for this.\nLeft-handed people may think differently. In one study, researchers showed the participants columns of abstract illustrations and asked them which ones they would prefer.Left-handed people were more likely to prefer the images on the left. Right-handed people preferred the ones on the right. Both groups disliked stuff on their opposite side.\nLeft-handers are also overrepresented in professional, interactive sports. Researchers have looked at the influence of being left-handed on performance and interactive sports.Those that require the fastest reaction give left-handers the biggest advantage. So if you have a left-handed child, you should encourage them to play table tennis, baseball and tennis. Being left-handed maximizes their chances of success in these sports.",
