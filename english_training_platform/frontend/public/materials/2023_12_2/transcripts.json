We know that friends are more likely to be the same age, gender, and ethnic background as each other. Now it seems their brains are alike, too. Researchers at the University of California scanned the brains of 42 classmates while they watched videos intended to provoke varying responses. Some people might find a romantic scene touching, for instance, while others would feel it was embarrassing. The activity of friends' brains was more similar than that of people who didn't know each other, particularly in regions involved in attention, emotion, and language. This similarity was strong enough that it could be used to predict whether two people were already friends or not. The relationship probably goes two ways: we are drawn to people who think like us; we then influence their thoughts over time, which may push their brain activity into more closely resembling our own.",

Walter was astonished to find that he matched with website user 'Robi737'. He knew immediately that this was his best friend, Alan, whose friends call him Robi, and flew 737 airplanes when he was a pilot. The pair were born to the same mother 15 months apart.",

My little nephew turns six, and he loves the zoo, so the whole family is going.\nM: Oh, okay then. I haven't been to a zoo since I was a kid.\nW: They are nowhere near as popular as they used to be when we were children. I personally feel sorry for the poor animals stuck in cages. But there's no denying they are fun and educational for children.\nM: Do you know if Dan will be around next Saturday?\nW: Yeah, I think he will. Just send him a text message. He's always keen on physical activities.\nM: That's true. Dan is extremely fit and healthy. He goes to the gym most days, plus tennis two or three times a week.\nW: So, what have you been doing to stay busy while you've had that swollen ankle?\nM: I've been catching up on some reading.

I've read articles recommending one million dollars as a good figure for retirement.\nM: While most financial planners do give numbers, I don't think that's useful, as people are living in different areas with different costs of living, and have different needs and wants, which is why I suggest that people aim for financial independence.\nW: What do you mean by financial independence?\nM: Having investment income that's greater than monthly expenses.\nW: That sounds risky to me. What if an accident happens, or you get ill and need medical treatment? Shouldn't people have extra cash for emergencies?\nM: Too many people spend their lives working on jobs they hate because they're afraid. So I counsel people to take risks. Retirement doesn't have to be permanent, and if people need to, they can go back to work.\nW: But it's not always easy to get back into the workforce after an extended absence.\nM: True, but if you keep current with your skills, you will be attracted to employers.\nW: Maybe, but how can anyone save enough to retire by 40 when most people can't retire at 60?\nM: Simple, by cutting housing, food, and transport expenses and investing half your monthly income.\nW: That sounds impossible.\nM: I admit it's difficult, but it has worked for thousands.",

This research found college students were more likely to choose healthy food in the presence of an observer of a different race, as opposed to an observer from their own race. The same was true when they were with someone from a different university compared to someone from their own. Researchers say this was because participants anticipated more negative judgment from an outsider group. In contrast, they felt less judged by members of their own group. In one experiment, participants were offered the choice between candy and fruit as a snack. When in the presence of an unknown student from their own university, only 12% of students selected the healthier option. However, this number was 31% when in the presence of an unknown student from another university. Other experiments showed similar results based on racial group. What's the reason for this pattern? The study found that people feel judged to a larger extent by members of other groups. Because of this, they strategically use healthy food choices to make a positive impression. There have been many attempts to help consumers make healthier choices, but consumers often struggle to maintain a healthy diet. This research finds that one way to promote a healthy diet could be to advertise the social benefits of healthy choices.",

'It's a really powerful finding,' said Patricia Pendry, who led the study. 'Universities are doing a lot of great work trying to help students succeed academically, especially those who may be at risk due to a history of mental health issues or academic and learning issues. This study shows that traditional stress management approaches aren't as effective for this population compared with programs that focus on providing opportunities to interact with therapy dogs.' The researchers measured executive functioning in the students involved in the study. Executive function is a term for the skills one needs to plan, organize, motivate, concentrate and memorize. These are skills students need to succeed in college. The research has found that students who were most at risk had the most improvements in executive functioning after interacting with therapy dogs. These results remained when researchers followed up six weeks later. Many universities provide academic stress management programs and workshops. These are traditionally very similar to college classes. They often talk about ways to get more sleep, set goals, or manage stress or anxiety. Pendry acknowledges that these are really important topics, and these workshops help typical students succeed. But they're less helpful for struggling students. Pendry believes those students may experience the programs as another lecture and feel even more stressed.",

On the contrary, taking risks in entrepreneurship involves careful planning and hard work. Nobody can really be sure if risks will be met with success, no matter how calculated they may be. But this should not stop you from taking risks, as risks are necessary if you want your business to succeed. Some risks may not work out, but an optimistic risk-taker will always look at failure as an opportunity to learn. The willingness to experiment with new ideas is key to business growth. As the old saying goes, 'Nothing ventured, nothing gained.' Failure will teach you how to think and plan strategically. But just remember that not all risks are good ones, and when you fail, learn from it and move forward. Since most people tend to avoid risk, businesses that are brave enough to take risks already have a competitive advantage. They are the ones setting the standard with new ideas, fresh offers, and bold inventions. Risk-takers are best at adapting in difficult times. Simply put, when most individuals stay away from risk, it means less competition for risk-takers. We don't know if you'll achieve what these risk-takers have achieved. But for as long as you want to stay safe and for as long as you are content with where your business is right now, you will never find out.",
